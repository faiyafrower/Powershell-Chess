# Powershell-Chess
Play a game of chess locally in PowerShell. Board layout from https://github.com/bhassen99/POSH-Chess. 

Requires at least PowerShell v5.0, which should be default in Windows 10, but must be installed for earlier Windows operating systems.
The PowerShell console cannot render unicode characters, which are used here to display chess pieces, so this should be run in the
PowerShell ISE
